## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local)

* **Break down complex problems:** If you're dealing with a complex issue, break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. Ask me to help you debug each part separately and think through problems step-by-step.

* **Use code fences:** When sharing code snippets, use code fences to ensure that the code is properly formatted. This makes it easier for me to read and understand your code.

* **Iterate and refine:** I may not always provide the perfect solution on the first try. Review the responses, ask clarifying questions, and provide additional information as needed.
